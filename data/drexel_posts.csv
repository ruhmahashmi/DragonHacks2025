The pros for Drexel would be the Co-Op and Diversity, with the quarter system being a con. The pros for Nova are the alumni network and ranking, with the con being a lack of diversity.

As I was getting my succulents, I noticed that as people left the 2 staff members behind the table would automatically start talking shit about the person who left if they didn’t like them. I’ve noticed this multiple times. 

After I was done making my pot, I was literally just looking at the plants to see which one was cool to point out to my roommate (who was sitting on the chairs nearby) and Nicole, one of the staff members behind the table called me out and embarrassed me and basically said I already have 2-3 plants and I should leave some for others, assuming I was going to take another plant for myself. Bro I stg these people are always fkn rude for no reason. That same person literally said like 5 minutes prior to someone else to take as many as they want since they need to do away with the plants. 

This is kind of a rant but also a kind of don’t live here warning. The staff members are literally insufferable. There has been multiple moments leading up to this post. The only nice people for the most part are the security people at the front desk and the maintenance staff, but the people from the leasing office literally don’t know what customer service is. I pay all this money to live in Drexel’s dumbass 2 year required property. The least you could do is put a fucking smile on your face and not treat your residents like shit.
