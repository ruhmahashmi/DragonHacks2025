"URGENT Summer Course Choosing (CS375, CS360, CS432)","I’m planning to take CS360 with Jeremy Johnson and CS432 with Sean Grimes, and the rest of my courses are pretty chill. I wanted to take CS375 with Galen Long, but they switched it to Boris, so now I’m unsure. How is Boris? CS432 is just an elective for me, but CS375 is part of my concentration. I'm worried they might end up being too hard. I'm a sophomore — I’ve taken up to CS260 so far, but I can’t take CS283 next term because I have to leave before finals for study abroad, and Brian Stuart didn’t let me take it.",2025-04-26 10:05:28,3
PLEASE help me choose between Villanova and Drexel for Engineering.,"Decision day is so soon so I'm freaking out. I'll be going in as a mechanical engineering major and will be commuting to both schools. The price is only a $2000 difference (Drexel is cheaper). The pros for Drexel would be the Co-Op and Diversity, with the quarter system being a con. The pros for Nova are the alumni network and ranking, with the con being a lack of diversity. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

How Can I Get an Exchange Semester?,"I’m a high school student in Germany, and I’m looking for the best university or Fachhochschule to pursue my bachelor’s degree, particularly one that offers a high chance of doing an exchange semester at Drexel University in the U.S.

My goal is to include this exchange experience in my master’s application to Drexel, so it’s very important to me. I would really appreciate any insights or recommendations on which universities or Fachhochschulen in Germany are particularly known for their exchange programs with Drexel.

So far, I’ve found the UAS7 Network, a consortium of seven German Universities of Applied Sciences, but I’m not sure which of these would be the best fit for my goal.

Why are the summit staff literally the rudest people on earth?,"Summit had a cute little plant event today. As I was getting my succulents, I noticed that as people left the 2 staff members behind the table would automatically start talking shit about the person who left if they didn’t like them. I’ve noticed this multiple times. 

After I was done making my pot, I was literally just looking at the plants to see which one was cool to point out to my roommate (who was sitting on the chairs nearby) and Nicole, one of the staff members behind the table called me out and embarrassed me and basically said I already have 2-3 plants and I should leave some for others, assuming I was going to take another plant for myself. Bro I stg these people are always fkn rude for no reason. That same person literally said like 5 minutes prior to someone else to take as many as they want since they need to do away with the plants. 

This is kind of a rant but also a kind of don’t live here warning. The staff members are literally insufferable. There has been multiple moments leading up to this post. The only nice people for the most part are the security people at the front desk and the maintenance staff, but the people from the leasing office literally don’t know what customer service is. I pay all this money to live in Drexel’s dumbass 2 year required property. The least you could do is put a fucking smile on your face and not treat your residents like shit.

Drexel vs SUNY Buffalo?,I'm an international student got admit from both the unis for MS in Data Science. I really couldn't determine the right fit for me. Drexel is super expensive CoA ($86k) per year. SUNY Buffalo is affordable ($53k) CoA per year. Drexel has it's own advantage like co-op and makes the networking opportunities better. But buffalo is like nowhere and don't know how I'm gonna search for internship and full-time. I spoke to a bunch of folks at CCI and they are telling that co-op is not guaranteed and since 2022 the percentage of students getting a co-op is declining. I've also heard that only 30% students get a co-op and it's even very hard to get one as an international student. Any one plz let me know how legit is this....Also plz do suggest me a good opinion either Drexel worth to spend or to go with SUNY Buffalo.,2025-04-21 06:26:35,4

Class scheduling is pain. I fixed it.,"I am a computer science student (not sure if I am getting a job in this market, so I decided to use my degree for something) and I hate finding classes and creating my schedules, so I created a tool to help with it.

[UCron @ Drexel](https://www.ucron.net/university/drexel-university/explore?term_code=202445) \- Page to search for courses

\*[Create an account](https://www.ucron.net/sign-up) to use other features like creating **plans** etc.

It's a website that helps you discover new, interesting courses that would otherwise be almost impossible to find in a typical course catalog. Here are some of the main features:

* **Generate a working schedule** from the courses and sections you picked—no more dealing with annoying overlaps
* **Courses and instructors have reviews!** \- reviews from our users + Rate My Professors
* **Explore Page** with lots of filters to help you find courses offered whenever and wherever you want (great for finding online classes) — and yes, it shows live enrollment data, so you don’t waste time planning around full sections
* **Track your completed courses, credits, and GPA** with the Course History
* *Coming Soon:* **Schedule generation with preferences**

It’s still a work in progress, so drop your feedback in the comments and let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to see added!",2025-04-20 15:35:13,101

Should I commit to Drexel as an undeclared- humanities major?,"Hi!

I'm a (not so) recently admitted student to Drexel and I am currently agonizing over whether I should commit. I love the premise of the co-op, as finding a job post-grad is one of my primary concerns, and I fell in love with the city when I visited, however, I have seen a lot of discouraging to students who aren't sure what they want to do with their future and are considering Drexel as an option. I know I don't want to do anything STEM related, however, a business undeclared major is still on the table. My overall question is– should I commit to Drexel if I am unsure of what I want my career to be in the future? My logic is that the co-ops will help me narrow down what I do and don't like, while still gaining experience, but is this the reality? Any advice is welcome, Thank you! ",2025-04-15 21:12:21,0

Is Drexel worth it for arts management?,"I’m looking to come to Drexel, and get at least a bachelor’s in arts management. After aid, and institutional scholarships, I’d be taking out about $35k a year in loans. 

Whats the average salary coming out of this for Drexel students?

What co-op options am I most likely to have?

What are the chances that if I reapply for the 3+2 in my freshman year for me to be approved for it then?

I’d be using this degree in the music industry, either in live music, or working for a label, radio station, or something similar.

built this open-source Android operator at hackathon,"Wanted to share what me and my crew hacked together at Bitcamp this past weekend. We built the same thing, a full-blown smart agent that runs on your phone and can do stuff like book an Uber, follow someone on LinkedIn, send a message if you're running late — all through step-by-step local control.

In our case, the difference is we're not using any vision models or image processing. Instead, we built our own grid-based image tagging system that helps gemini to translate interface elements into grid unique code at runtime. Then we simply convert it back to coordinates in the app. It’s fast, doesn’t rely on pixel detection, and works pretty reliably across apps.

We religiously studied and followed browser-use for the RAW prompt logic + function calls, glued them together with a tons of caffeine, zero sleep, and questionable file structure.

We do have a memory layer and agent state handling, so it’s not just one-off actions — it can plan and recover when it gets stuck. It's all kinda messy right now (code-wise), but it works end to end and we’d love for y’all to take a look and poke around the codebase.

Drexel Might Stop Allowing Students on Co-op to Take Classes??,"So I just heard a rumor from an advisor that Drexel might be trying to remove the ability for students on co-op to take classes at the same time. Not sure if this is just internal talk or something that’s actually in motion, but it caught me off guard.

I know a ton of people (myself included) rely on taking a class during co-op to stay on track—or get ahead. Honestly, it feels like a huge step backward if this becomes a thing.

When I try to ask them, they tell we don't have the recent stats. Why's that so? I hearing a lot that people securing co-op is declining and barely less than half of the class secure a co-op. Is this piece of information true? Another thing is they didn't offer me much financial aid only 10%. My CoA is $86k per year (tuition alone is $58-59k). Drexel was my go to school but these things are scaring me! Do many people secure a co-op? And what about the three rounds a/b/c?

I know Drexel has a lot of problems but,"This sub is filled with a lot of negativity, and honestly warranted negativity that even I have partaken in. However the benefit of co op in today’s world is invaluable. I have had multiple interviews and post grad offers and my experience puts me above others and even on the same playing field as masters students in some cases.

I have friends from other top schools struggling to get jobs, some a year graduated and still struggling and unemployed. They lack the experience that we get here, for that I am grateful that I gained valuable experience that has helped me in my job search. 

This school has its many downsides, but the upsides can make it worth it. At the end of the day this will be our Alma mater and we should be proud of it. 

Edit: For some reason people are acting like this post discredits the issues this school has and the struggles people have faced. Let me be clear, fuck the majority of the Drexel Admin. They absolutely suck and have done irreparable damage to this school. BUT that doesn’t mean there aren’t positives here and that some people enjoyed and benefited from their experience here. In today’s world we can all use a little bit of positivity man, it’s rough out here, we already go to this school, negative mindsets are incredibly destructive, I urge everyone to search for the positives because they do exist!

MPH Decision Help: Drexel vs. Rutgers,"Hi everyone! I’m currently deciding between a few MPH programs and would really appreciate advice from folks in public health, especially those who’ve gone on to do a PhD in Epidemiology.

My career goal is to work in epidemiology- ideally work in the government sector- and eventually pursue a PhD in Epidemiology. I want to make a smart, long-term decision that balances academics, networking opportunities, and cost.

Here are the schools I’m deciding between:

1. **Drexel University** – Gave me a scholarship for 26k, which helps with the cost of the program. I like their hands-on-research, focus on urban health, small class size, and there is an internship embedded in my program. On the other hand, it's a private university, so the cost is significant even with aid (out-of-state student). 
2. **Rutgers University** – Has the professor that I want to work with when doing research, strong public health program, close to NY, and has an emphasis in population health. More exposure to different types of methods in research. However, I didn't get any scholarships and I am an out-of-state student. So, the cost is also significant even with aid as well.

**My questions:**

* **Academics/Career:** Which school might offer the best connections and prep for getting into the CDC or landing strong research fellowships (like ORISE, EIS, etc.)? 
* **PhD Preparation:** Does it really matter where I get my MPH if I’m aiming for a funded PhD later or does it matter what I am emphasizing in? Should I get my masters here in the States or go abroad to obtain my masters? 
* **Loan Strategy:** If I take out loans for my MPH, what are the best ways to manage or reduce them before/during a PhD program (which might offer a stipend)? Are there any forgiveness programs or jobs that help with that? 
* **Real-World Advice:** If you've done an MPH then a PhD, what would you do differently, and how did you handle finances? 

Any advice or personal stories—especially if you’ve worked in government positions or navigated MPH → PhD transitions—would be amazing. I'm just trying to make the best decision for my future without drowning in debt.

"Selling Brand-New, Unopened Multivariate Calculus Textbook","Hello!

If you're a mathematics, engineering, or CCI student at Drexel as I was in the not-so-distant past, I have just the textbook for you!

Back in my freshman year, I stupidly bought a textbook for my Multivariate Calculus course only to find that the professor had all of the pages we needed scanned and distributed to us for free. Isn't that great???? Don't you love when that happens???? Despite the ""NON RETURNABLE IF SHRINKWRAP BROKEN"" label on the textbook and the shrink wrap being completely intact, the Drexel bookstore refused to give me a refund.

Anyway, it looks like similar books are purchasable for nearly $125 and rentable for about $50. Since textbooks are quite possibly the world's biggest legal form of thievery (aside from crypto and Cleveland Browns tickets), I wouldn't want to sell it for more than $40.

Send me a DM if you're interested in purchasing it.

Here is the info for the book:

Title: Calculus Early Transcendentals  
Edition: 11th  
Authors: Howard Anton and Irl C. Bivens  
Additional Info: Physical copy of the book that also contains a code for the eBook (or e-book if you wanna get fancy with it).  
Condition: Brand-new, unopened

Is Drexel worth it???,"Hi, I’m a senior in high school from Maryland, and I applied to Drexel University. I’m very excited about it! Originally, I applied for the PPE program, but I am considering changing my major to law and business or economics. I visited Drexel on New Dragon Day, April 11, and I fell in love with the city. I can truly see myself going to class and having fun while joining clubs—just like I envision my day-to-day life being there. It’s a feeling that not many schools can give you, and I really like the co-op system; it feels like a cheat code for getting some financial support while attending college. 

However, I’m currently unable to afford the tuition. Initially, they awarded me a scholarship, which brought the annual cost down to $40,000. After submitting an appeal for financial aid, the new estimate was around $39,000 per year. Drexel seems like an amazing school, and I desperately want to go there. Even with the scholarships I might receive from local organizations, my family and I would still be looking at around $30,000 to $20,000 a year in expenses. 

My parents said they can help figure something out if I really want to attend Drexel, but I’m wondering if this financial leap of faith is worth it. Any advice you could offer would be greatly appreciated!

edit- Many people have advised me that if I want to attend Drexel University, I need to have a specific career in mind and a clear idea of what I want to do. My goal is to get into law school and become a lawyer, specifically an attorney with a background in business or international relations. However, I also want to ensure that my college major will support me in case I decide not to pursue a career in law. Regardless, I plan to pursue a law degree at Drexel as a minor. I have enjoyed meeting some of the people in the program, including the professor and the head of the department, who all seem really nice.",2025-04-05 23:39:13,11

Councilwoman Gauthier said Drexel is “Selectively Enforcing” Food Truck laws and asks the University to Reconsider Enforcement!,"Tomorrow, April 4th is slated to be when Drexel and the City crack down on the enforcement of food truck laws in the Drexel Area. They also told us to go to City Council with our concerns since there was “nothing they could do” - so we did. 

No clue on whether or not Drexel will carry out with this, but the backing of a City Councilmember is huge! Our work here isn’t done. Thank you to everyone who showed their support by signing the petition and making your voice heard. 

We’ll have further updates for the trucks in the future, the ball looks like it’s in Drexel’s court now.",2025-04-03 19:03:09,135

Application essay,"Hey everyone, I'm planning to transfer to Westphal College next fall and I'm a bit confused about the essays. Can anyone tell me how many I need to write? I reached out to the school advisors, but I got conflicting answers. I found two essay topics on the Drexel and Westphal websites, but I'm not sure if I need to choose one or submit both. Any insights would be really helpful!

  
1: All full-time applicants (except Nursing ACE) must submit a 250- to 650-word essay. Please write about any topic you choose. However, the Admissions Committee prefers applicants to discuss their transfer experience and why they are interested in Drexel University. Essays can be submitted through the Application, in your Discover Drexel portal, or by emailing [enroll@drexel.edu](mailto:enroll@drexel.edu).

2: Reflect on your experiences, personal characteristics, and unique traits that have prepared you for the challenges and opportunities associated with your chosen major. How have these things shaped your goals, aspirations, and potential contributions to your field of study? (Maximum 500 words)

Besides, Is there any essay format guidelines for these essay?

An Update to the Food Truck Situation,"(Reposted from the [petition](https://chng.it/sX8YWB7qvK)) - Last night, with the help of USGA (Drexel Undergraduate Student Association), a Food Truck Forum was held with Senior Leadership at Drexel to discuss the recent news. This meeting was attended by Subir Sahu, Brian Keech, Chief Mel Singleton, Karen Lewis, and Katie Zamulinsky, where they answered questions from the Drexel Community. We are currently working on getting a recording of this meeting.

In short, **the issue we are currently facing is** [**a Philadelphia City Ordinance** ](https://files.amlegal.com/pdffiles/Philadelphia/150056-A.pdf)that prevents Food Trucks from staying overnight or operating outside of described hours, among many other regulations, but the overnight rule has seemingly been the greatest source of pain for these trucks. Drexel has made the point that they are simply enforcing and upholding the regulations set by the City and the Philadelphia Health Department, as well as ensuring all vending trucks have equal enforcement. None of the food trucks in question are on Drexel private property, but on property of the City of Philadelphia. 

There were numerous solutions proposed, including commissary/reserved parking for vendors, but the vending laws of the city still don't protect these trucks in regards to staying overnight, and don't resolve the issue that is causing Pete's to close. **The solution we are seeking will likely have to come from the City of Philadelphia/Philadelphia City Council**, and we will have to develop a plan to suit these vendors. Drexel has encouraged us to do so. 

**Our representative on the City Council is Jamie R. Gauthier. You can connect with her** [**here and make your voice heard** ](https://phlcouncil.com/jamiegauthier/)**(before April 4th!)** Although the exact solution isn't clear yet, we all know and share the sentiment that we want these trucks to stay. *Regardless of how much you may feel the enforcement of this ordinance is warranted,* we must unite behind the pressing issue, which is that our favorite food trucks are facing extreme struggles because of this.

**So what do we do now?**

* There were a lot of people that stayed after tonight's meeting to discuss potential solutions. This includes looking at other models of universities in the area who have food trucks stay overnight, as well as drafting a bill to the City Council. There is no ""best"" solution at the moment, which is why...
* **We have created a** [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/JMRZJ7pHyN) **to manage all communications.** [**You can join here!** ](https://discord.gg/JMRZJ7pHyN)This is intended to be an open forum for anyone to join, so your voice is heard and ideas/resources can be shared. **Don't panic, organize!**
* **CONTACT OUR COUNCILMEMBER!** Make your voice heard by leaving a call or message. [https://phlcouncil.com/jamiegauthier/](https://phlcouncil.com/jamiegauthier/)



This isn't the first time the Drexel community has faced this issue. Here are some media mentions of food trucks in the past!

Current Drexel Promise Transfer Students: What’s Your Real Out-of-Pocket Cost? (Low-Income),"Hey everyone, I’m hoping to get the REAL numbers and advice from current transfer students at Drexel who are attending through The Drexel Promise program. i live 30 minutes away and have a car so i will be commuting. 

I'm looking to transferring this fall with my associate’s degree, and I qualify for The Drexel Promise, so I’ll be getting 50% off tuition. I’m also a low-income student, so I expect to qualify for a solid amount of federal and state aid (Pell Grant, PA State Grant, etc.).

What I’m trying to figure out is:

What does your actual out-of-pocket cost look like after all aid is applied?

Do you still end up needing loans? If so, how much per year or quarter?

Any hidden costs, fees, or housing expenses that caught you off guard?

Also:

How much has co-op ACTUALLY helped you financially 

Are you living on or off campus?

Are you getting any extra scholarships (like Phi Theta Kappa)?

Would you say it’s financially manageable overall?

Feel free to comment ill actively be replying

EDIT: 

The goal is to offset the cost as much as possible with co-op (avg pay for my major 27/hr)",2025-04-01 06:41:50,3

Custom dual grad degree?,"Hi everyone!
I’m currently getting my online MBA at Drexel part-time as I also work full-time.  

When I was deciding which masters to get I knew an MBA made more sense for me and my current career, but I also really heavily considered the masters in Public Policy.  

I know that with my current MBA I could get a grad minor in law or public policy, and maybe if I could do both I would be fine with that but as it is I can only choose one. 

So my next question was can I get a dual degree with public policy.   Drexel has a few dual degree programs available, but I was surprised that the MPP/MBA was not an option as it’s a fairly common dual degree.  There are already a couple courses the two share and plenty of elective space available in both that it would be doable.  

I asked my grad advisor and she told me it’s not possible.  The only ones available are the ones approved.  However, I know a lot of schools have the option of creating a dual degrees as long as you work with both programs and get it approved.  

So I wanted to see if anybody had done this or has any knowledge about how to go about creating a custom dual degree that doesn’t already exist/isn’t already approved.  If no one has any knowledge about this then I understand there’s nothing I can do about it, I just don’t understand why this wouldn’t be possible.  

TLDR: has anyone been able to create/get approved for a custom dual grad degree that doesn’t currently exist?  If so, what was the process? ",2025-03-31 15:06:33,1

Are they scammers or something because it has literally posted to my account as aid, and they literally added that money separately and they’re saying it’s part of the “Drexel grant” when that money has basically been recorded as them giving aid!
