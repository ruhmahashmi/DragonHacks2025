1k8wqyw,Question on Co-op program and Drexel as a whole,"
I just got recently admitted to Drexel university for the user experience program. I am trying to figure out what exactly is the co-op program and is it worth it. Also Iâ€™m just trying to figure out if Drexel as a whole is worth it because I have been trying to decide between Drexel and two other schools I got accepted into. Please any advice and suggestions are appreciated!! ",2025-04-27 01:38:47,1,0,neutral,academic,"['Drexel University', 'co-op program', 'user experience program', 'college decision', 'admission']",17
1k8spco,Need Help with Housing!!!,"I'll be a first year master's student in the fall quarter, and I need to find housing but I'm from California. Are there specific areas to avoid? Specific landlords / realtors to avoid? And how early should I try to find housing? Would it be too late to find an apartment if I go look at some in August? (My program starts September 9th). Also if anyone is a graduate student, do people typically rent studios or try to find roommates?",2025-04-26 21:39:15,2,1,negative,housing,"['housing', 'apartment', ""master's student"", 'first year', 'California', 'landlord', 'realtor', 'avoid', 'graduate student', 'rent', 'studios', 'roommates', 'September', 'August']",17

I wanted to take CS375 with Galen Long, but they switched it to Boris, so now Iâ€™m unsure. How is Boris? CS432 is just an elective for me, but CS375 is part of my concentration. I'm worried they might end up being too hard.

1k8dfqv,PLEASE help me choose between Villanova and Drexel for Engineering.,"Decision day is so soon so I'm freaking out. I'll be going in as a mechanical engineering major and will be commuting to both schools. The price is only a $2000 difference (Drexel is cheaper). The pros for Drexel would be the Co-Op and Diversity, with the quarter system being a con. The pros for Nova are the alumni network and ranking, with the con being a lack of diversity. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!
